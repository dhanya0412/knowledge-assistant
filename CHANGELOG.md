### Added

#### Automated Document Processing

* Integrated NLP pipeline into document upload workflow
* Automatic text extraction during upload

* Automatic summary generation during upload

### Changed

#### Document Upload

* Documents are now processed immediately after upload
* Upload requests now trigger:

  * Document parsing
  * Text preprocessing
  * TF-IDF keyword extraction
  * Extractive summarization
* Successfully processed documents are stored with:

  * `summary`
  * `processed = true`

#### Database Storage

* MongoDB now stores processed document content instead of placeholder NLP fields
* Processed metadata is generated before document insertion

### Improved

* Added cleanup of uploaded files when NLP processing fails
* Prevented insertion of partially processed documents
* Improved validation for empty and non-processable documents
* Improved upload reliability through end-to-end processing checks

### Testing

* Updated document upload integration tests

* Added validation for cleaned text persistence
* Added validation for empty document rejection
* Added validation for upload cleanup after processing failures

### Verification

* Verified end-to-end upload workflow using Postman
* Verified processed document storage using MongoDB Compass
* Verified automatic population of summaries and keywords after upload
